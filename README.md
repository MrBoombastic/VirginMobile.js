# VirginMobile(Polska).js

### Programatically fetch data about your phone number such as balance etc.

# How to use?

Edit config.js and enter your login and password. Install Node.js and run `npm i` in root directory. Then
run `anyproxy-ca` in your terminal and launch app by `node index.js`. Response will be stored in VMdata.json and VMdata-human.txt.

Some portions of this app are in Polish (only some output), because this app works only with Virgin Mobile in Poland. But they are comments in index.js to clarify meaning, if you want.
